// Comp Comp POST to listener.
// For open -> Grab last two part of url (E.g, /954/G)
// Turn it into a directory (E.g, G954) || Maybe allow a config setting to have the directory style as 954->G i.e a directory 954 (the contest id) and then G in it as a separate directory. 
// The config would allow easier grouping for later added fo problems.
// Create two files test_case.in & test_case.out in that directory 
// Write test_case.in; Put tests.input(s). Delimit each by ###
// Write test_case.out; Put tests.input(s). Delimit each by ###
// Copy default template to sol.cpp
